# Python-statistics-based-inference
This Python notebook will explore the relationship between the time spent on home-school transportation time and weekly time spent studying Portuguese, based on data gathered in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. This is an example of how to use Python to understand statistical correlation and make inferences.
To further explore the question about how the travel time affects weekly study time, I amperforming a difference of means significance test. Furthermore, a long-time travel, for the purpose of this study, is set up to more than 30 minutes (So, Travel-time groups 3 and 4), and short weekly study time is defined as 300 minutes or less (So, groups 1 and 2)  . The significance level is set to default Î±=0.05.
